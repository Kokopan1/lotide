//Idea 1
//could you also copy the string and set all the values as zero
//if it doesnt match any properties in the object then push it into the object
//if it does match the object, then increase the value of the key by 1

//Idea 2
//push the element as a kay-value pair into an object
//if it doesnt match any properties in the object then push it into the object
//if it does match the object, then increase the value of the key by 1
